\title{Wrap strings to a specific width with hyphenation while preserving
indentation}
\usage{
str_indent_wrap(x, width = 10, tab_width = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An input character vector}

\item{width}{The desired width of elements within the output character vector}

\item{tab_width}{The number of spaces to which tabs should be converted}
}
\value{
A character vector with string wrapping applied
}
\description{
`str_indent_wrap()` leverages `stringr::str_wrap()` under the hood, but takes
some extra steps to preserve any indentation that has been applied to a
character element, and use hyphenated wrapping of single words that run
longer than the allotted wrapping width.
}
\details{
The `stringr::str_wrap()` is extremely highly efficient, but in the context
of table creation there are two select features missing - hyphenation for
long running strings that overflow width, and respect for pre-indentation of
a character element. For example, in an adverse event table, you may have
body system rows as an un-indented column, and preferred terms as indented
columns. These strings may run long and require wrapping to not surpass the
column width. Furthermore, for crowded tables a single word may be longer
than the column width itself.

This function takes steps to resolve these two issues, while trying to
minimize additional overhead required to apply the wrapping of strings.

Note: This function automatically converts tabs to spaces. Tab width varies
depending on font, so width cannot automatically be determined within a data
frame. As such, users can specify the width

str_indent_wrap(ex_text1, width=8)
str_indent_wrap(ex_text2, tab_width=4)
