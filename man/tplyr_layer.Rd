\title{Create a \code{tplyr_layer} object}
\usage{
tplyr_layer(parent, target_var, by, where, type, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{parent}{\code{tplyr_table} or \code{tplyr_layer}. Required. The parent
environment of the layer. This must be either the \code{tplyr_table} object
that the layer is contained within, or another \code{tplyr_layer} object of
which the layer is a subgroup.}

\item{target_var}{Symbol. Required, The variable name on which the summary is
to be performed. Must be a variable within the target dataset. Enter
unquoted - i.e. target_var = AEBODSYS.}

\item{by}{A string, a variable name, or a list of variable names supplied
using \code{rlang::quos}}

\item{where}{Call. Filter logic used to subset the target data when
performing a summary.}

\item{type}{"count", "desc", or "shift". Required. The category of layer -
either "counts" for categorical counts, "desc" for descriptive statistics,
or "shift" for shift table counts}

\item{...}{Additional arguments}
}
\value{
A \code{tplyr_layer} environment that is a child of the specified
  parent. The environment contains the object as listed below.
}
\description{
This object is the workhorse of the \code{tplyr} package. A
\code{tplyr_layer} can be thought of as a block, or "layer" of a table.
Summary tables typically consist of different sections that require different
summaries. When programming these section, your code will create different
layers that need to be stacked or merged together. A \code{tplyr_layer} is
the container for those isolated building blocks.

When building the \code{tplyr_table}, each layer will execute independently.
When all of the data processing has completed, the layers are brought
together to construct the output.

\code{tplyr_layer} objects are not created directly, but are rather created
using the layer constructor functions \code{\link{group_count}},
\code{\link{group_desc}}, and \code{\link{group_shift}}.

\section{\code{tplyr_layer} Core Object Structure}{
 \describe{
  \item{\code{type}}{This is an attribute. A string indicating the layer
  type, which controls the summary that will be performed.}
  \item{\code{target_var}}{A quosure of a name, which is the variable on
  which a summary will be performed.} \item{\code{by}}{A list of quosures
  representing either text labels or variable names used in grouping.
  Variable names must exist within the target dataset Text strings submitted
  do not need to exist in the target dataset.} \item{\code{cols}}{A list of
  quosures used to determine the variables that are used to display in
  columns.} \item{\code{where}}{A quosure of a call that containers the
  filter logic used to subset the target dataset. This filtering is in
  addition to any subsetting done based on \code{where} criteria specified in
  \code{\link{tplyr_table}}} \item{\code{layers}}{A list with class
  \code{tplyr_layer_container}. Initialized as empty, but serves as the
  container for any sublayers of the current layer. Used internally.} }

  Different layer types will have some different bindings specific to that
  layer's needs.
